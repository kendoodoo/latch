Airdrop, but not Airdrop. For iOS 6 (currently). Not released yet.

# how?
Taking advantage of mDNS, it is possible to achieve Airdrop-like transfer via HTTP uploading.

### other features:
- upload media directly to the Photos app (by manipulating its database)
### possibly?:
- QR code pairing

# "latch"?
Latch represents a connection and sounds catchy enough. Also you HAVE seen this orange-white design somewhere. I just like to copy stuff.
